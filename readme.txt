I chose a dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics. 
The dataset contains characteristics about employees in a company and whether an employee has left that company.
My initial question about this dataset is whether the leave rate differs among departments of the company.
To answer that question, I aggregated the data by department and leave factor, and plotted the count of employees that left over total number of employees in that department.
Data aggregation was done by exporting from Tableau.
Following this, I will further explore other ways to group the employees (e.g. by pay, satisfaction level) and compare the leave rates to determine which groups are most/least likely to leave the company.
